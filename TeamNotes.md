#### Class on Tuesday (9/21):
*What we learned:*
  - Using the slot tag to improve progressive enhancement
  - How to prevent tabbing to link and button with tabindex
  - How to create replicants of the button in index.html and changing the text/link with <slot> tags

  *Plans going forward:*
  - Add in dark mode/high contrast accessibility
  - Improve responsiveness on resize (button text moves at incredibly large scales)
  - Get more comfortable with using shadowRoot


#### Thursday, Sept. 16:
- During class, we decided that we would take the weekend to each make an attempt to build a simple button using the open-wc framework.
    - This button would have some of the CSS that our model button had, allowing us to critique each other's designs.
- In class, we also created a GitHub repo and two branches so we would work individually then merge our code together later on.

#### Monday, Sept. 20:
- We met to look over one another's code and gauge progress.
- Following our code review, we both pushed our code to our branches and merged our changes based on what we felt works best going forward.

#### *Individual Contributions*
- Ashad: Have all button attributes ready to go; currently adding css to view the button.
- Drew: Create a hyperlinked button that has responsive resizing and css properties set up.
