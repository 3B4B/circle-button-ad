#### Thursday, Sept. 16:
- During class, we decided that we would take the weekend to each make an attempt to build a simple button using the open-wc framework.
    - This button would have some of the CSS that our model button had, allowing us to critique each other's designs.
- In class, we also created a GitHub repo and two branches so we would work individually then merge our code together later on.

#### Monday, Sept. 20:
- We met to look over one another's code and gauge progress.
- Following our code review, we both pushed our code to our branches and merged our changes based on what we felt works best going forward.










#### *Individual Contributions*
Ashad: Have all button attributes ready to go; currently adding css to view the button.
Drew: Create a hyperlinked button that has responsive resizing and css properties set up.
